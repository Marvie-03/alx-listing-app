# ALX Listing App

This project is a clone of a listing page, similar to Airbnb, created as part of the ALX Software Engineering program. The goal is to build a functional and visually appealing web application for listing properties.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

-   `components/`: Contains reusable React components used throughout the application.
    -   `common/`: Contains generic, widely-used components like buttons and cards.
-   `interfaces/`: Defines TypeScript interfaces for data structures used in the project, ensuring type safety.
-   `constants/`: Holds constant values used across the application, such as API endpoints or configuration settings.
-   `public/assets`: Stores static assets like images, icons, and other files that are publicly accessible.
